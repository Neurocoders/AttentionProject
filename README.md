# AttentionProject - NMA Group Project
Branch 2 members : Manil, Mahdi, Keerthana

# To-Dos:
1. Write codes to obtain Fourier Transform for LFPs (play around with any method - STFT, Wavelet, Conventional FT etc)
2. Visualize the power spectrum for the Fourier Transform 

Note from Mahdi: if possible, write separate functions for: 1- initial filtering to remove noise (gaussian, moving average etc) 2- frequency band separation
