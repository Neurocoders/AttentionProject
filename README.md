# AttentionProject - NMA Group Project
Branch 2 members : Manil, Mahdi, Keerthana

# To-Dos:
1. Write codes to obtain Fourier Transform for LFPs (play around with any method - STFT, Wavelet, Conventional FT etc)  --- Done
2. Visualize the power spectrum for the Fourier Transform  --- Done
3. Integrate the codes for plotting LFPs and their FFTs  - Mahdi (To Do)
4. Filtering data and adding it to the LFP function 
5. Integrate high pass filtering and smoothening -Manil (Done)
6. Function to calculate rolling window pearson correlation - Manil (Done)
7. Built naive bayes classifier for one-side correct stimuli - Done
8. Have added option of choosing alpha, theta bands vs raw LFP data - Done
  
Note from Mahdi: if possible, write separate functions for: 1- initial filtering to remove noise (gaussian, moving average etc) 2- frequency band separation
